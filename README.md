## HAR model training
 You may read the README in the main project git repositoy here: https://github.com/aasmundvassbotn/HAR-model-app
 This Git repo was created to hold the notebooks, since these caused issues with Streamlit Cloud hosting.

The notebooks in the "notebooks"-folder were experimental in the early stages of this project and were not used in the end.
